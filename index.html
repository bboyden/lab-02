<p>
  This lab was all about getting comfy with git and the command line. I learned how to like make folders, create files, and run a bunch of git commands in the terminal. I setup my git user stuff, added files, ignored some too (which was kinda cool), and even messed around with branches. Also used VS Code to do some of it. It was very hands-on and made git less scary.
